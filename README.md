# tiples/welcome
A composable application for Clojure Tiples.

The welcome program will let you login as either Sam or Fred and then displays "Welcome {Sam|Fred}".
You can then select the tab/capability of interest: welcome, profile or contacts.
These capabilities vary based on user name, e.g. Kriss can not access contacts.

To run this program, enter the command "boot dev" from the welcome repository directory on your computer
and then point your browser to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).

Account names (Sam, Fred, Kris) have the same password, 
but lowercase. I.E. "sam", "fred" and "kris" respectively.
