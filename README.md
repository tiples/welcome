# tiples/welcome
A basic tiples application.

Welcome will let you login as either Sam or Fred and then displays "Welcome {Sam|Fred}".

To run this program, enter the command "boot dev" from the welcome repository directory on your computer
and then point your browser to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).

Account names (Sam, Fred) have the same password, but lowercase. I.E. "sam" and "fred".
